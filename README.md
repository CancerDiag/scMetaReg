### A Single-Cell Network Approach to Decode Metabolic Regulation in Gynecologic and Breast Cancers

**Authors:** Akansha Srivastava, P K Vinod

## Abstract

Cancer metabolism is characterized by significant heterogeneity, presenting challenges for treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Understanding this heterogeneity and its regulatory mechanisms at single-cell resolution is crucial for developing personalized therapeutic strategies. In this study, we employed a single-cell network approach to characterize malignant heterogeneity in gynecologic and breast cancers, focusing on the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms driving metabolic alterations. By leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we assessed the metabolic pathway activities and inferred cancer-specific protein-protein interactomes (PPI) and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We explored the crosstalk between these networks to identify key alterations in metabolic regulation. Clustering cells by metabolic pathways revealed tumor heterogeneity across cancers, highlighting variations in oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, cholesterol, fatty acid, hormone, amino acid, and redox metabolism. Our analysis identified metabolic modules associated with these pathways, along with their key transcriptional regulators. Notably, transcription factors related to ER stress, immune response, and cell proliferation, along with hypoxia-inducible factor and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins were found to drive metabolic reprogramming. These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between metabolic rewiring and transcriptional regulation in gynecologic and breast cancers, offering potential avenues for targeted therapeutic strategies in precision oncology. Furthermore, this pipeline for dissecting coregulatory metabolic networks can be broadly applied to decipher metabolic regulation in any disease at single-cell resolution.
